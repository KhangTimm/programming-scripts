Advice:
- Use the command line



Expectation: Build routine ability to
- set up C / C++ projects either in Visual Studio or on the command line
- output strings with printf, maybe even integrating local variables or function values you computed. 
- implement loops that do what you intended
- understand the principle of recursion (building up at the moment)
- solve yourself the majority of the tasks given to you

Expcetation: Build good knowledge of
- the theory (complexity for now)


If you want to become a famous computer scientist, find an interesting problem and
- take a mathematical formulation and make it efficient as an algorithm
