\begin{task}{Problem Solving - Written Addition from School}{}{}
  A big part of programming is related to problem solving and algorithmic thinking: how do I decompose a problem into simple steps that can be executed. Using the Modulo (remainder of an integer divison, see \url{https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mod.html} function implement the algortihm of written addition from school.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item{Given two row vectors \code{x =[1,2,3,4]} and \code{y = [5,6,7,8]}, write a program that adds them as numbers 1234 + 5678, which should be 6912.}
    \item{If you haven't done already, write the addition program as a function taking two arbitrary column vectors representing the numbers}
  \end{enumerate}
