\begin{task}{Pulse Width Modulation}{}{}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item{Explain in a single sentence, how PWM can be used to create analogous information
      using a digital circuit.}
    \item{Draw the signal of a PWM signal with 50Hz and a duty cycle of 75\% with time on
          the X axis and voltage on the Y axis}
    \item{Using a high-frequency clock and a counter, implement a PWM signal generator in digital electronics. Tip: Take a counter and a comparator. Let the counter count and overflow from its maximum value to zero. Now, the comparator compares to an integer number specifying the duty cycle (how long on compared to how long is each loop). Simulate your design.}
