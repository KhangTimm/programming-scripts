\begin{task}{Permutations}{}{}

Sometimes we need to look at different combinations of a set of inputs.
This means we need to generate all possible permutations of an input
set.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textbf{Permutations of 3 Numbers:} Given a vector with 3 different numbers
  like \code{[1,2,3]} write a MATLAB program that generates all possible permutations into a new
  matrix each permutation on a new row. The output should be a matrix with three columns
and each row being a different permutation, that is, similar to
\code{ [[3, 2, 1]; [2, 3, 1]; [2, 1, 3]; [3, 1, 2]; [1, 3, 2]; [1, 2, 3]]}.
}
\item{\textbf{Permutation of a vector:} Extend the previous program to create all permutations of a vector of 4 values.}
\end{enumerate}

\end{task}
